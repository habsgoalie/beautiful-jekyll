Hello, intrepid reader! The last couple years have been in turns challenging, fun, at times frustrating, but overall transformative. Like many of my colleagues, and maybe like you, my career in IT is undergoing a shift. It is no longer enough to be a "point and click" engineer. This is true even if you specialize in Windows. No, these days you need to code, and be familiar with development principles and methodologies.

I've had some fun and interesting experiences on this journey, so I decided to start a blog to share some of them with you. I hope you enjoy it!
