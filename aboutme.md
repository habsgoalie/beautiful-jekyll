My name is Kevin Olson. I am Systems Engineer living in Southern NH and working just outside of Boston MA.

Some things I work on:

- Automation with PowerShell
- Leveraging Azure IaaS
- Providing IT Services in a decentralized company
- Expanding DevOps philosophy and mindset to Enterprise IT

When not at work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and 4 unschooled children, exploring the world, making frequent trips to Disney World and rooting for my beloved Montreal Canadiens hockey club.
