title: Microsoft Ignite 2016 
subtitle: I presented at Ignite 2016!
---

This year I got the opportunity to present at [Microsoft Ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com). I presented with the [Azure Storsimple](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/azure-storsimple) team and the team from [Talon Storage](http://www.talonstorage.com/). In this presentation we discussed my company's journey towards consolidating our global file services on a cloud based storage solution.

During this talk I also discussed how we leveraged PowerShell and Desired State Configuration to deploy this solution. Below is a link to the video of my talk.

If you are curious about how we use PowerShell to manage Storimple, check out my Github Repo, [StorsimpleVolumes](https://github.com/habsgoalie/StorsimpleVolumes). It's a handy script I wrote using the Azure PowerShell module commands to automate the creation and management of volumes in the Storsimple service. I will also be publishing some blog posts on how we used DSC to deploy our file services and the Talon software as well, so stay tuned!
