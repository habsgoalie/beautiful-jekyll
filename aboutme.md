subtitle: A few things to know about me
---

My name is Kevin Olson. I am Windows Systems Engineer living in Southern NH and working just outside of Boston MA.

Some things I currently work on:

- Automation, particularly with PowerShell
- Leveraging Azure/AWS IaaS
- Providing IT Services in a decentralized company
- Expanding DevOps philosophy and mindset to Enterprise IT

When not at work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and 4 [unschooled](http://www.holtgws.com/whatisunschoolin.html) children, exploring the world, making frequent trips to Disney World and rooting for my beloved Montreal Canadiens hockey club.
